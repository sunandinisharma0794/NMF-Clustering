# NMF Consensus Clustering
R script performs consensus Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) to find the best clustering based on the presence and absence of genomic events across a patient cohort. This script generates the Kaplan Meyer curves for every k=4,5,6,7,8,9,10. 

# Input 
A dataframe containing genomic events such as focal copy number changes, mutations along the rows and the columns are the patient samples.
